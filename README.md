# Example of using [Apache Thrift http servlet](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/java/src/org/apache/thrift/server/TServlet.java) in Clojure


Implementation of the Thrift Servlet with Clojure Ring/compojure.

## WHY?

Because I can not run a Java Servlet directly with Ring and I needed to call Thrift services throught HTTP.
